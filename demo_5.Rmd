# Introduction

This is an `R` code chunk

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
data=rnorm(100)
plot(density(data), main = "")
```

This is a evaluated but not displayed `R` code chunk

```{r, echo =F, eval =T}
mean_data = mean(data)
```


This is an inline `R` code: Hence, the mean of the data is of `r mean_data`.

This is a $\LaTeX$ equation 

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}}
$$
