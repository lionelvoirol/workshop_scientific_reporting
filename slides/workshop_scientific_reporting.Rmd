# Scientific reporting


###  What is scientific reporting and its challenges? 
**Scientific**
<blockquote>

conducted in the manner of science or according to results of investigation by science : practicing or using thorough or systematic methods 
.right[-- <cite>Merriam-Webster</cite>]
</blockquote>

&nbsp;

**Report**
<blockquote>
give a spoken or written account of something that one has observed, heard, done, or investigated.

# Rmarkdown 


`Rmarkdown` (or R Markdown) is a syntax for creating documents using literate programming. This technique allows the combination of document narrative and code computation to dynamically generate documents in different formats. This allows the creation of scientific reports that combine textual elements written by the authors with computed elements, such as visual representations or the results of a statistical analysis or data modelling.

# Rmarkdown
### Technologies


<blockquote>
In a nutshell, R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).

# The `YAML` header

The `YAML` header declare various elements of the aesthetics and compilation options of your document.

- Title, author, date, ouput format ( $\LaTeX$ for `.pdf`), theme, `css`, `pandoc` options, etc

Since compiling a `.Rmd` document in `.pdf` requires $\LaTeX$, and that you may not all have $\LaTeX$ already installed, we will mostly consider compilation in `.html` for the presentation. **Note that installing $\LaTeX$ and linking it to `RStudio` is a simple and straighforward procedure and that most elements discussed today can be included in `.pdf`-compiled `Rmarkdown` document**

Find a detailed procedure to install the `tinytex` $\LaTeX$ distribution at this webpage [Install LaTeX (TinyTeX) for PDF reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html) (required if you want to do the project with `RMarkdown`).

# Structure

```{r, eval =F}
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```


# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

---
# Table of content

A table of content (`toc`) can be included with the `YAML` option `toc: true`.

```{r, eval =FALSE}
---
title: "demo"
author: "Lionel Voirol"
date: "4/25/2021"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true #<<
    theme: united
---
```

Which will produce, depending on the specified styling and other parameters:
.center[![:scale 20%](assets/toc_1.png)]



---
# Text styling

Use `*` or `_` to emphasize things:

```{r, eval =F}
**this is in italic*  and _so is this_  

***this is in bold**  and __so is this__ 

****this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___ 

```


&nbsp;

*this is in italic*  and _so is this_

**this is in bold**  and __so is this__

***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___


---

Lists 

```{r, eval =F}
- The - character start an unsorted list.
+ or you can also use the + character or the - character


To start an ordered list, write this:
1. this starts a list *with* numbers
2. this will show as number '2.'
53. a wrong number here still shows as number '3.'

```
- The - character start an unsorted list.
+ or you can also use the + character or the - character


To start an ordered list, write this:
1. this starts a list *with* numbers
2. this will show as number '2.'
33. a wrong number here still shows as number '3.'

---

# Tables

You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

```{r, eval =F}
| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

```

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |

| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

# Printing an output as a table with `knitr::kable()`

```{r}
data("iris")
knitr::kable(iris[1:5,])
```

There are many more options that can be set to have particularly good looking table with the `knitr` and `kableExtra` packages ([see here for a detailled documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html)).

---
# Extended table options with `knitr::kable()` and `kableExtra`
```{r}
library(kableExtra)
mtcars[1:4, 1:8] %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(2, color = spec_color(mtcars$mpg[1:4]),
              link = "https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/") %>%
  column_spec(6, color = "white",
              background = spec_color(mtcars$drat[1:4], end = 0.7),
              popover = paste("am:", mtcars$am[1:4]))
```

# $\LaTeX$ support

### Centered Equation

```{r, eval =F}

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}}
$$
```




$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}}
$$
    
    
### Inline equation

```{r, eval =F}
Hence, we consider the vector $\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}$
```

Hence, we consider the vector $\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \boldsymbol{\Theta}$



---
# Inline `R` code and `R` code chunks 

```{r, echo =F}
res_1 = 12.68
res_2 = 14.56
```


```{r, eval =F, echo = T}
The upper and lower confidence intervals are `r res_1` and `r res 2`.  #<<
```

The upper and lower confidence intervals are `r res_1` and `r res_2`.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=4}
set.seed(123)
data = rnorm(500)
mean_x = mean(data)
hist(data)
```

# `knitr` options

In a `.Rmd` document, you can specify multiple chunk option in the ````{r}` header of a `R` chunk of code.

Chunk options are written in the form `tag=value` like `echo=T`

Here are the ones I use the most frequently (Find an exhaustive list of `knitr` options [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options).):

| `knitr` chunk option      | Description | 
| :---                   |                :--- |  
| `echo`              |                 Whether to echo the source code in the output document (someone may not prefer reading your smart source code but only results).       | 
| `eval`               |                 Whether to evaluate a code chunk.        | 
| `results`               |                 When set to 'hide', text output will be hidden; when set to 'asis', text output is written “as-is,”        | 
| `cache`               |                 Whether to enable caching. If caching is enabled, the same code chunk will not be evaluated the next time the document is compiled (if the code chunk was not modified), which can save you time.        | 
| `fig.align`, `fig.width`  & `fig.height`             |                 The (graphical device) size of R plots in inches. R plots in code chunks are first recorded via a graphical device in knitr, and then written out to files.        | 



---
# Bibliography

- Save a file in the same directory of your `.Rmd` file with extension `.bib`.
- Reference this file in the `YAML`.
For example considering the file `biblio.bib` 

```{r, eval =F}
---
title: Scientific Reporting
author: Lionel Voirol
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
output:
  html_document:
    css: "my_style.css"
    toc: true
    theme: united 
bibliography: biblio.bib #<<
---
```

You can then insert citation as such:
```{r, eval = F}
"L'absurdité est surtout le divorce de l'homme et du monde." @camus1972etranger
```

# Customization and template for `.pdf` compilation

When compiling a `.Rmd` document to a `.pdf` format, you specify customization by specifying $\LaTeX$  and `pandoc` options. If you compile a `.Rmd` document to a `.pdf`, you specify `CSS` and `HTML` options. You can find further details about customization of `.pdf` compiled-report [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html).

If you want to use `RMarkdown` for your semester project and want to consider customizing the default `.pdf` compilation options, we suggest that you consider using the package `stevetemplates` that provides some template for `Rmarkdown` academic report compiled in `.pdf`.

To do so, install the package from `CRAN`:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("stevetemplates")
```

In `RStudio` you can then go to `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown` and select any template you’d like to use.

# Themes

You can specify themes with the `YAML` option `theme`. `Rmarkdown` provide built-in themes but many themes are accessible by using external packages available on `CRAN` or on  GitHub. Two packages offer several templates:

- `prettydoc` by Yixuan Qiu
- `rmdformats` by Julien Barnier
